# BEV_simulation_backward_approach
MATLAB-based BEV simulation using WLTP and FTP-75 drive cycles. Evaluates vehicle dynamics, tractive effort, and energy use. Includes motor sizing for torque, power, and base speed based on vehicle parameters. Provides a modular framework for EV performance analysis and drivetrain component selection.
